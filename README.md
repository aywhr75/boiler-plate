## Composition of boiler plate

> It consists of the user's registration page, login page, and main page.

> When the user finishes registration, the user data is encrypted and stored in the MongoDB, 
> and the user's information is also saved in the cookie by creating a token.

> When the user logs in to the login page, the user goes through the authentication step and goes to the main page if there is no problem.

> Assume that page visitors are divided into general/login/admin.

> The status of each user determines which pages are accessible.

> Logout page does not exist separately, and logout is possible on the main page.

> After logging out, the page is moved to the login page.
